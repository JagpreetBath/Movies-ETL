# Movies ETL

## Project Overview

Amazing Prime Video is a platform for streaming movies and TV shows on Amazing Prime, the world’s largest online retailer. The Amazing Prime video team would like to develop an algorithm to predict which low budget movies being released will become popular so that they can buy the streaming rights at a bargain. To inspire the team, have some fun, and connect with the local coding community, Amazing Prime has decided to sponsor a hackathon. Providing a clean data set of movie data and asking participants to predict popular pictures. Britta, a member of the Amazing Prime video team has been tasked with creating datasets for the hackathon. There are two data sources: a scrape of Wikipedia for all movies released since 1990, and rating data from the Movie Land’s website. The propose of this project is to help Britta extract the data from the two sources, transform it into one clean data set, and finally load that data set into the SQL table.
